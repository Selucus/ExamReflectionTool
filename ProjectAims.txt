Reflecting on the results of homework and exams is an extremely key method for improving as a student.
During my time as a student, we would often not be encouraged to reflect properly on our results or if we were we would be given paper sheets that were often lost.
I aim to create a web page for students to review their past reflections and create actionable goals which they can track over time.
