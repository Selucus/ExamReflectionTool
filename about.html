        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This project was written as a late entry to the YCW SummerHacks hackathon. The task was to: <br><br><strong>Develop a tech-based solution that targets a challenge or enhances learning experiences within the field of education. </strong>
        <br><br> Due to time restrictions, I had to refine my ideas into projects that would be suitable for fast development. Due to my personal experiences with struggling to reflect effectively on homeworks and end-of-topic tests in school, I settled on this idea which is designed to aid with pupils who are reflecting and completing DIRT.
